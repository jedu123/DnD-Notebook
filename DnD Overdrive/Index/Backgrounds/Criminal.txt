====== Criminal ======
You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that permeates the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.

===== Variant: Spy =====
Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practised them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.

===== Creating your criminal =====
Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honour among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority. You can usually see they acting thanks to honor, freedom, charity, greed, people, and even redemption.
 There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves’ guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialities. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others.
