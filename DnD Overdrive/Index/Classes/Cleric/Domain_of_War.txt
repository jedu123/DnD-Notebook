====== Domain of War ======
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage  and gods of conquest and domination. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.
