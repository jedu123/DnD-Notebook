====== Legends, Gods, and Divinity ======

===== The Creation of All =====
In the beginning, there was only Vasileo, the Realm, filled with Aether, the prime-matter of all creation. At some point two "seeds" appeared, the Seed of Order and the Seed of Chaos, they were capable of altering the Realm around them. The changes they caused would make them move, up to the point that they collided with each other. Their impact would bring forth six beings of high power: Ure, the Creation; Fthora, the Decay; Epithymia, the Desire; Drasi, the Power; Alagi, the Change; and Paravatis, the Destruction. Made from Order and Chaos, they begin the process of shaping Vasileo to a total balance of their primordial forces while learning about what they were. Paravatis was the first to notice the most crucial thing; since they should use themselves as part of the creation, they were not supposed to be eternal.
 After knowing that, the Six decided to before finishing their great creation they would make the Sanctums, a place where they would not be affected by each other aspects, and agents, the Primordials, to keep their work after they isolate themselves. The Six Sanctums were crucial to impart their concepts over the whole creation, while the Primordials allowed them to finish the Multiverse just with enough time to fall in an eternal slumber on their private planes. To enable the Primordials to help, they created the Seven Pillars of Power: metaphysical structures that would be a mix of their concepts stored as "bricks". Six of the Pillars have an element (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, and Shadow) and an essence (Energy, Matter, Space, Time, Life, and Death), while the seventh had something that is both element and essence at the same time, Soul.

===== Mapa Astralis and the Position of Primus Mundus =====
 To understand and navigate through Vasileo those who know about it use the Mapa Astralis, a particular device that charts all known positions and ways on the Multiverse using a multilayered sphere. It divides the Realm into Inner and Outer Realms and shows the path made by the Pillars of Creation.
 On the Inner Realm we have the Aetherstorm, the core of creation from where come all the Aether; the Materia Mundi, the material planes that are connected through the Pillars of Creation, which are more like threads than pillars, to each other and different layers; last the Sea of a Million Voices, or Spiritual Plane, where the souls must go through before reaching their destination. Between the Inner and Outer Realms, there is the Other Side, where the Shadowfell and the Fey Wilds are.
 After the Other Side, you reach the Outer Realms. The innermost layer is Hiera Mundi, where the divine and conceptual planes are. After that place is Gris, a grey river/sea that filters the emanations that come from the Sanctums and fills the in-betweens of Vasileo. And just before the Unknown Wastes, a strange land existing after the boundaries of creation, there is Sanctum: were the Six rest to recover from the ordeal that was creating the Multiverse.
 Among the planes on Materia Mundi, there is one that thanks to fortune or fate has all the elements and concepts in perfect balance, Primus. In Primus, there is Aerin, a continent named after the goddess of union and resilience that once roamed that very land to guide the mortal races to become the kingdoms and societies that now populate the world.

===== The Divine =====
The gods are entities similar to the Primordials, but way more powerful thanks to the amount of Aether used to make them. However, this amount of power comes with an important limitation: they are gods only in their universe, whenever they step out of it they become mortals and their powers are reduced to the same level of a Greater Animus.
 Gods were created by the Six to rule and tend to their planes of existence, by direct command or as examples to mortals. Gods come in all shapes and sizes, being embodiments of dozen of concepts and ideas. There are essentially three kinds of gods: Aether Gods, made by the Six and the Primordials; Wild Gods, mortals that ascended to godhood by becoming avatars of concepts or ideals; and Material Gods, Animus and Patrons that began to represent more than their original concept, thing, idea, place, or animal. 
 Most of the gods like to watch from afar, lending their power to those who assist them in advancing their agenda. Some like to reward those of strong faith, and others like to punish those who aren't faithful enough. Regardless of how they deal with mortals, they are usually fond of those mortals that want to learn their tenants, emulate their ideals, and to be their tools in their great schemes and plans.

===== The Creation of Mortals =====
The mortals are the result of the constant leaking of Aether from the Aetherstorm creating masses of soulless life on the planes of existence. The Primordials shaped the mortal beings alongside the Aether Gods, using the Pillars instead of their own essence. While it allowed the Gods to remain immortal, it gave humanoids, monsters, animals, and plants a soul. This soul, after their death, would retain traces of their memories and feelings allowing them to be able to come back, make part of the Million Voices, or even to go to the afterlife, therefore, being immortal in another way.

The mortal beings, their history and culture will be better explained in the following chapters.
