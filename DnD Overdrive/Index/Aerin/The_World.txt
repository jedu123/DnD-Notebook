====== The World ======

Aerin is a large continent, with something around 17 million square kilometers completely charted. The ocean around it is hard to navigate thanks to supernatural reasons, therefore even going to Padaro is especially challenging. In the past, when the Gods were present in our world, they fought each other to see who would rule the continent. This period became known as the Divine Clash. After millennia shaping the world and its history they went to the Beyond, where the gods have their private sanctums. 
After the Divine Clash, there was the Age of Strife, the frame of time where the clans and tribes began to unite under someone's banner and becoming kingdoms. After that came the Runnarian Invasion, an extraplanar threat that forced the countries to work together. Now the world lives through an age of peace and growth maintained by the League of Aerin.

* The World is Magical: Magic is something that you can learn how to use, and is commonplace among people how to use some of the most common magical items.
