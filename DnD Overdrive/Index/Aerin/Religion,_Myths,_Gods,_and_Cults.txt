====== Myths ======

===== The Creation of All =====
In the beginning, there was only Vasileo, the Realm, filled with Aether, the prime-matter of all creation. At some point two "seeds" appeared, the Seed of Order and the Seed of Chaos, they were capable of altering the Realm around them. The changes they caused would make them move, up to the point that they collided with each other. Their impact would bring forth six beings of high power: Ure, the Creation; Fthora, the Decay; Epithymia, the Desire; Drasi, the Power; Alagi, the Change; and Paravatis, the Destruction. Made from Order and Chaos, they begin the process of shaping Vasileo to a total balance of their primordial forces while learning about what they were. Paravatis was the first to notice the most important thing; since they should use themselves as part of the creation, they were not eternal.
After knowing that, the Six decided to before finishing their great creation they would make the Sanctums, a place where they would not be affected by each other aspects, and agents, the Primordials, to keep their work after they isolate themselves. The Six Sanctums were crucial to impart their concepts over the whole creation, while the Primordials allowed them to finish the Multiverse just with enough time to fall in an eternal slumber on their private planes. To enable the Primordials to help, they created the Seven Pillars of Power: metaphysical structures that would be a mix of their concepts stored as "bricks". Six of the Pillars have an element (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, and Shadow) and an essence (Energy, Matter, Space, Time, Life, and Death), while the seventh had something that is both element and essence at the same time, Soul.

===== Mapa Astralis and the Position of Primus Mundus =====
To understand and navigate through Vasileo those who know about it use the Mapa Astralis, a particular device that charts all known positions and ways on the Multiverse using a multilayered sphere. It divides the Realm into Inner and Outer Realms and shows the path made by the Pillars of Creation.
 On the Inner Realm we have the Aetherstorm, the core of creation from where come all the Aether; the Materia Mundi, the material planes that are connected through the Pillars of Creation, which are more like threads than pillars, to each other and different layers; last the Sea of a Million Voices, where the souls must go through before reaching their destination. Between the Inner and Outer Realms, there is the Other Side, where the Shadowfell and the Fey Wilds are.
 After the Other Side, you reach the Outer Realms. The innermost layer is Hiera Mundi, where the divine and conceptual planes are. After that place is Gris, a grey river/sea that filters the emanations that come from the Sanctums and fills the in-betweens of Vasileo. And just before the Unknown Wastes, a strange land existing after the boundaries of creation, there is Sanctum: were the Six rest to recover from the ordeal that was creating the Multiverse.
Among the planes on Materia Mundi, there is one that thanks to fortune or fate has all the elements and concepts in perfect balance, Primus. In Primus, there is Aerin, a continent named after the goddess of union and resilience that once roamed that very land to guide the mortal races to become the kingdoms and societies that now populate the world.
