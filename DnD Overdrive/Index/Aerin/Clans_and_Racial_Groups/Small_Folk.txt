====== Small Folk (Beaglann) ======
The Beaglann is composed of two different races that work together since before the divine clash: Halflings and Gnomes. Both kinds extremely empathetic and resourceful, they defend each other, the halflings with their connection to nature and the gnomes with their ingenuity. In Aerin, they inhabit the kingdoms Durgora and Gijur, and their alliance inspired the founding of the League of Aerin.

===== Halflings (Tapaidh) =====
For the //tapaidh// few things are better than turning where they are their homes: a peaceful and quiet place, a blazing fire and a generous meal, excellent drink and fine conversation. The only thing they regard as just as good is to discover the wonders of new places and faces. 

 The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by bravery and diplomacy. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries avoiding unnecessary wars and political conflicts. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds. Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, beards are rare among them and moustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favouring bright colours.
 Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem and have little patience for dithering.

==== Halfling Heart ====
The halflings are famous for being inclined to heroism. They hold courage and kindness in high regard, understanding that every action to bring another one's happiness and safety is heroic; therefore, even those without the resolution to become adventurers do their best to help whoever is in need. Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.

===== Gnomes (Eadar-ghnàth) =====
A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighbourhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
 A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shine through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 90 centimetres tall and weigh 18 to 20 kilograms. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their large noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair tends to stick out in every direction as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around. 
 A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels
 Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.

==== Gnome Curiousity ====
As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savour the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
 Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.
