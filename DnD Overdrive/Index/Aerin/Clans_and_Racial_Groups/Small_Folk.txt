====== Small Folk (Beaglann) ======
The Beaglann is composed of two different races that work together since before the divine clash: Halflings and Gnomes. Both kinds extremely empathetic and resourceful, they defend each other, the halflings with their connection to nature and the gnomes with their ingenuity. In Aerin, they inhabit the kingdoms Durgora and Gijur, and their alliance inspired the founding of the League of Aerin.
