====== Small Folk (Beaglann) ======
The Beaglann is composed of two different races that work together since before the divine clash: Halflings and Gnomes. Both kinds extremely empathetic and resourceful, they defend each other, the halflings with their connection to nature and the gnomes with their ingenuity. In Aerin, they inhabit the kingdoms Durgora and Gijur, and their alliance inspired the founding of the League of Aerin.

===== Halflings =====
The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. They are lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and, most of all, their homeland.
The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by bravery and diplomacy. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries avoiding unnecesseary wars and political conflicts. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds. Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.
