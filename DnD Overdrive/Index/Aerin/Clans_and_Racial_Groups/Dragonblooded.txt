====== Dragonblooded ======
The collective races that are descended or created by dragons are known as dragonkin or dragonblooded. They tend to believe that everyone is born predestined to something, farmers will be farmers, soldiers will be soldiers, scum will always be scum, and on the top of everything, dragons will be dragons. Both their lineage and a divinatory ritual that happens in the moment of birth, decide their position on this system.

===== Dragonborn (Zachitnik) =====
Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by the draconic animi themselves to guard and protect, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The dragonborn have scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, black, gold, or green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 2 metres tall and weighing 135 kilograms or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.

==== Dragonborn Clans ====
To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonbornâ€™s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.
