====== Elvenkind (SÃ­ofra) ======

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, amid ancient forests or in silvery spires, where music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

Their unearthly grace and fine features sometimes appear as an alien beauty to anyone who lays its eyes on them. They are slightly taller than humans on average, ranging from 1,80m to 2,20m. They are more slender than humans, usually weighing around 60kg. There is no default elven coloration, but usually, they tend to have pastel and light coloration both on skin and hair. Their eyes glow in the most diverse colors, long eyebrows and even longer ears that grows the more the time pass.

Elves can live well over a thousand years, giving them a broad perspective on events. They are curious and proud, tending to remain aloof when dealing with "younger" races. This way of life changes the second they put their mind on something, becoming relentless pursuers of perfection. It is easy to get on their good side, but slow to become a real friend or enemy. Elves are known for their capriciousness and flexibility.


===== Elf Time =====

An elf can live up to two thousand years and is considered an adult just after their first century. This absurdly long lifespan reflects on how they rationalize and feel, being more often amused than excited, and more curious than greedy.

Another trait that comes with time is that their oaths, pledges, and vows are alive while THEY are alive. For an elf, to collect the debt three generations later, or to protect a child until their adulthood thanks for an oath made to a friend almost five hundred years before is commonplace.
