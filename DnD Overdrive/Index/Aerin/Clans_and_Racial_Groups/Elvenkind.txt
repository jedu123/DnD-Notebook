====== Elvenkind (Síofra) ======
The hedonistic //Uasal// in their silver cities, the recluse //Fiáin// around their baobab, the proud //Drow// under their sunless sky. These are the //Síofra//, the elven, the people that were among the gods during the Divine Clash, witnesses to the birth of Man, Small Folk and the Warring Hordes. Magical and graceful, they love nature and art and do their best to make the things they love a constant in life.
 Elves usually leave the other races in awe thanks to their supernatural grace and exotic features. They are taller than humans, ranging from 1,80m to 2,20m, and considerably slender, weighing around 60kg to 70kg. There is no default elven coloration, but often, they tend to have pastel and light coloration both on skin and hair. Their eyes glow in the most diverse colors, long eyebrows and even longer ears that grow the more the time pass.
 An elf can live up to almost 1500 years and is considered an adult just after their first century. This absurdly long lifespan reflects on how they rationalize and feel, being more often amused than excited, and more curious than greedy. It is easy to get on their friendly side, but slow to become a real friend or enemy.


===== Elven Time =====
 Elves can live well over a thousand years, giving them a broad perspective on events. They are curious and proud, tending to remain aloof when dealing with "younger" races. This way of life changes the second they put their mind on something, becoming pursuers of perfection. Be it adventuring on a mission, learning a new skill, or training their bodies and minds, they become focused and relentless. 
 They are flexible, trusting in diplomacy and compromise before violence, even "waiting" invaders out of their lands. However, when the need arises, they reveal a sharp and efficient martial side.

===== Part of the Land =====
Yshan, Llaie, and Faie, all share two things in common. They are elven land, and their nations are built as part of the local nature. They hunt, gather, and plant, never harming the land or its animus and patrons. In return the land helps them to feed themselves, to nurture their young, and to keep their kingdoms safe.

===== Elven Traits =====

==== Ability Score Increase ====
Dex+2

==== Age ====
An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 1500 years old.

==== Alignment ====
Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.

==== Size ====
They are slightly taller than humans on average, ranging from 1,80m to 2,20m. They are more slender than humans, usually weighing around 60kg. Your size is Medium.

==== Speed ====
Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

==== Darkvision ====
Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were a bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

==== Keen Senses ====
Elves contemplate the world around them regularly, seeking illumination or enjoying nature. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

==== Fey Ancestry ====
With their roots within the Feywild came a significant change in the elven mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

==== Támh ====
Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Ezor word for such meditation is "trance.") During támh, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

==== Languages ====
The elven speak Teanga, a fluid, and rich vocabulary, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Every elf is taught how to speak, read, and write in Teanga and Ezor.

==== Subraces ====

=== Uasal (High Elf) ===
As a uasal, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic and combat. You believe to be superior to every other race thanks to your connection with the Animi, even to other elves, and likes to revel in your hedonistic lifestyle. You are usually friendly to them, but sometimes it's hard not to act as they are children or ingenious animals. The uasal lives majorly in Yshan, the Silver City, but can be found all across the continent.

=== Fiáin (Wood Elf) ===
A fiáin has sharpened senses, a strong intuition and a powerful connection to nature. Your fleet feet can carry you quickly and stealthily through the forests. After the losses during the Runnarian Invasion, your kind became reclusive, living around the giant baobab, Kardia, and tending to the woods that protect them. The fiáin can be found inside Llaie unless some strong reason moves one to the life of adventuring.

=== Uisceach (Sea Elf) ===
The uisceach are stubborn, ingenious and resilient. Your adapted fingers allow you to swim faster, and your gills take out the need for air. As the weaker faction in the War for the Trident, the uisceach were enslaved by the tritons and merfolk. Those who escaped went to the Free Isles, trying to turn the tide in favour of their new homes and the still captured friends.
