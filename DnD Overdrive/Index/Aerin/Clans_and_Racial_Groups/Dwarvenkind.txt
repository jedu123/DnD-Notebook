====== Dwarvenkind (Zwerg) ======
Bold, stoic, loyal and hard are the dwarves. Valuing honesty and honor above all things, the dwarves are incapable of lying since their creation, therefore a dwarven promise is just as unbreakable as the mountains of Dantarrim. Their dedication to whatever craft they choose to pursue, allied to a long lifespan, made them famous warriors and artisans.
 A dwarf can reach close to 1,5m and weigh around 80kg. Their legs are short but powerful, and their arms are strong, ending in mighty and large hands. Their skins have tones of earth, and their hair is usually black, grey or brown, but sometimes there are dwarves with red or a metallic tint.
 A dwarvenkin can live up to 400 years old and can easily remember things that happened before their first century of life. It is not unheard of dwarves that held a grudge against generations of the same family, or that carried a friendship from father to son for centuries.

===== Dwarves and Names =====
A dwarven name is composed of three parts: a common name, a clan name, and a deed name. Their parents give the first, usually based on portents or dwarven history, a sign of the bond between the newborn and the Great Clan.
 The second is granted by a clan elder, per tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of it and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.
 Last, but not least, is the deed name, a name given by their peers, for things that the dwarf have done, akin to a title. Since they can't lie, this name is a brand on the dwarf's personal history.

===== Clans and Realms =====
The core unit of the Zwerg is the clan. Even away from their homes they will cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize allies and protect relatives. A group of clans is an Alliance, and the alliances are responsible to choose among its members who will occupy the chairs during the Great Meeting. Dwarves have no kings or emperors, it is expected that each clan can handle its issues itself or in their alliance. The dwarven territory is shared among the Alliances after a Meeting, that will share with the clans based on their needs. Arguments between chieftains over a plot of land or the access to a resource are quite common, and usually settled after first blood in a single battle, mock wars or a crafting challenge. Traditionally, at the end both shall drink from the same keg and eat from the same plate, to remember that even after everything, they still allies.
 They respect the traditions of their clans and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Wronging a dwarf is the same as an offense to the entire clan, sometimes turning individual feud into a full-scale clan war. Usually, the youngsters seek guidance with their elders and are taught the clan's FÃ¤higkeit, the kind of craft they favor. After initiated by one of the clan's Meister, they are expected to always deliver their very best and never stop improving.
