====== Ar'ktar ======
Undoubtedly, Ar'ktar barely suffered the passage of time. Before every other race, Dorulgar and Morion united themselves to create a living calamity, a beast more powerful than any common animus. The result was Drakkon, the first dragon. To defeat it, Aerin, Aenar, and Corellus had to fight side by side for twenty years. The place that Drakkon fell became an active volcano, and from this volcano came out the Animus of Chromatic Dragons, T'mat and the Animus of Metallic Dragons Bar'mut. The siblings took out the Heart of Drakkon and revealed to the gods that their father wasn't dead. To prove their loyalty to the deities, T'mat and Bar'mut bound the heart in robust chains enchanted by the animi to hold while they exist, and above it, they founded the beginning of their kingdom: the Dragon Kingdom of Ar'ktar. Receiving the blessing of the three gods to move on, their realm shows almost no change, just as the dragons that rule it. There, they believe that everything has a permanent place to be, a soldier will always be a soldier, a farmer a farmer, and a dragon will always be a dragon.
