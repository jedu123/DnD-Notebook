====== Great Marshes ======

The region known as The Great Marshes is a large moor that sits between Dantarrim, Yshan, and Llaie. Once a sanctum to Meriol, God of Treachery and Survival, the place became a quagmire during the Divine Clash and the dark energies that were used still wound the land. The people that live there try their best to make most of their situation, fighting every day against creatures and the curse that is enrooted in the quagmire they live in.

===== History =====
It is said that Meriol, the God of Treachery, used the place as a hideout during the Divine Clash until his battle against Jari, Goddess of Undeath, over the Otherside. Before his arrival, the place was covered in a dense and green forest, but his presence was enough to turn it into a treacherous maze of poison plants and twisted creatures. Jari, instead of waiting for him to accept the formal challenge, assaulted the place with her army of living dead and turned the place into a giant swamp with her magic, leaving no other choice to Meriol than fighting her head-on and suffering a humiliating defeat.
