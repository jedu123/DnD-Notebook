====== Llaie ======
Surrounded by the lush forest of Frey and the unyielding Emerald Wall is Llaie, one of the three elven cities. After suffering many casualties during the Age of Strife and the Runnarian Invasion, they isolated themselves inside their territory and avoided contact with the outside world. They still keep receiving visitors and maintain the trade of ironbark, even after this self-imposed exile. 
 They live in a giant commune, without rulers and kingdoms, consulting the elders and druids for guidance instead. Their laws and lives are firmly based on their traditions, with every child learning them on the baobab from the Archdruid conclave. Kardia, as is named the giant tree, is the heart and might of Frey, between its roots, is the most potent terminus on Eastern Aerin. The elves made houses on its branches, and storages inside the holes in its trunk. Under Kardia's shadow, sits the Archdruid and whoever seek his wisdom. It is said that in a moment of dire need, the baobab will make an ultimate display of power, saving Llaie and the whole forest from demise.
