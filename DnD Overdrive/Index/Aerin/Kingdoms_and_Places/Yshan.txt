====== Yshan ======
Yshan is the place that the uasal built Cathair Airgid, the silver city of the uasal and one of the three elven cities. The whole kingdom is a peaceful grassland, with sparse woods here and there. The commoners, mostly humans and half-elves, pay their taxes annually in crop, adoration, gold, or goods. While Yshan looks like a regular place, three things must be made very clear. First and foremost, the area is one of the few that you can see an Animus walking and breathing, and it is a grave crime to attack any Animus. The uasal boast a deep connection with those ancient spirits, and the quantity and quality of your allied spirits directly reflect upon your status. Second, the hedonistic and paradoxical uasal lifestyle can be seen on every corner of Cathair Airgid, from the arrogant traders to the relation Animus-Uasal. Last, but not least, every Animus must be treated with the utmost respect, this is the second law of Yshan, the first being "never harm or insult an Animus". Every three years a month-long festival happens on Cathair Airgid to celebrate Anima Primus, Mother of All, this festival is called "Soul Parade". There, the nobles will choose as High Arbiter, leader of the city, the one with the most impressing Animi Parade.
