====== Etrin ======

 They are suspicious of foreigners, non-humans and magic. Despite their xenophobic side, they usually are willing to help their next of kin thanks to the Church of Aerin. One important thing to keep in mind while in Etrin is their rules and superstitions about the use of magic.

===== History =====
In the past, the Soul Covenant, a coven of tieflings and elves, ruled the land known as Purpur Fields. They conquered the local clans and used them like cattle to their rituals and slaves to their domains. Rising against the Covenant was almost impossible until Heinzbarn Blutmeister, an apothecary serving under the Witch Queen, found an old enchanted scroll. It contained The Blood Pact, the same spell used by the Witch Queen to bind herself to the other witches.
 Understanding this as his only chance to free his people, Blutmeister found allies in four other clans that were willing to fight against their tyrants. The warlord Eliah Norgrand, the runemaster Helen Ravenholdt, the smuggler Vincent Etar and the pirate brothers Edward and Francis Malkadir. After the ritual changed their bodies, they became resistant to the witches' mind control and hexes, while they became able to penetrate the enemies wards.
 After ten years of war and revolution, they took down Bloodboiler Avanca, the Witch Queen, and renamed Purpur Fields to the Free Land of Purpur. After five more years to unificate the Free Land into the Kingdom of Etrin. Naming it after a legendary beast, his peers chose Blutmeister as the First King.
 Around seven hundred years later, Aerin was invaded by the Children of Runaar, an interplanar threat that forced the kingdoms of the continent to work together. Etrin's efforts were vital to the war, lending weapons and soldiers to spearhead the battle operations that led to the aerinian victory.

===== Geography and Demography =====
The Kingdom of Etrin is a peninsular country, isolated by the sea around and the Dantarim Range at North. It has a lot of arable land and two major rivers (Moselle and Lech) that spring on the northern border. It has a dense forest close to the hills and mountains and changes to grasslands when approaching Gran Port at South.
Nowadays Etrin has opened their borders a little more, negotiating with Dantarrim and Yshan for their exotic prime matters. The etrinian economy is now based on free trade, maritime trade, state-of-art artefacts and agriculture. They used to mine the northern mountains and iron veils to supply the military and the artisans, that paired with agriculture, and their xenophoby made them recluse and auto sufficient.
95% of the population is human, with the other 5% being dwarves and elves, among other non-human races. There are, although, few spellcasters comprising 15% of the populace and being majorly arcane and divine casters.
 There are four essential cities besides the capital, Etar, Granport, Fort Norgrand, and Ravenest. They are located close to each border, while Blutgart stays in the centre of the kingdom.
Etar is the central commercial hub of the kingdom; it controls the flow of goods coming through the northern border. Just like Gran Port, they do not have the same fear and despise for foreigners like the rest of the kingdom. The deceased Lord of Etar, Immanuel D'Etar, was a fair and wise man until his tragic death during the witch hunt against his younger daughter Eve. A natural pyromancer, the child came to be the actual leader of the Arcane Liberation Force, while the whole family was purged. Nowadays Etar is managed by an elected regent that changes every two years.
On the western border, among the rock beaches sits Ravenest, where the secretive artificers of the Ravenholdt clan watch over the city from their sanctum, the Nevermore Tower. The town is auto-sufficient and focused on its art. They design, create and maintain all kinds of artefacts and magic items. The city is full of merchants and alchemists ready to enrol in a craft house to create the next greatest etrinian invention. Among the clan members, there are the Talons, a group that works together with the Ravenholdt Inquisition to secure, contain and protect blueprints and devices.
Fort Norgrand is where all members of the etrinian military call home. The fortress towers over the rocky beaches and farms, watching over the eastern border. During The Sieve, the first year that suitors that want to join the military, the soldiers go through a rash mental and physical training at Fort Norgrand, where the officers root out the weak of mind and heart. After that, those who didn't surrender will be sorted in the functions of the military, be it the Army, the Guard, the Navy, or the Hunters, and receive a more specific drill.
On the southern border rests Gran Port, Malkadir's domain. Gran Port is not only, as the name implies, Etrin's maritime trade hub but also a beacon of free speech in the kingdom. Due to the constant contact with other cultures and ideas, Gran Port became a haven to non-sanctioned mages, druids and any non-human beings. The city is famous for its Open Market, a place where free traders from land and sea can come to negotiate their products and exchange information. The Malkadir Inquisition is the only Cadre to work in broad daylight, helping the Guard and Hunters around the town and hiring adventurers and mercenaries to help.
And in the central region of the kingdom is their capital, Blutgart. The fortified city is a perfect circle divided into three areas, the Core, the Middle Ring and the Outer Ring. The Core, with the central plaza and governmental buildings; the Middle Ring, where most of the commerce and noble houses are; and the Outer Ring, the residential area for commoners and travellers. From any point of the city, you can see the Blood Throne and the Royal Academy of Sanction. One of the most remarkable things is that no white flowers grow in Blutgart, except in the royal palace. All others have a strange, blood crimson tint.

===== Culture =====
Etrin is a kingdom heavily influenced by their geographical isolation, the connections with the Church of Aerin, and their past conflicts with The Soul Covenant. Suspicious of foreigners, non-humans and spellcasters, living in close-knitted communities, the etrinian commoner lives to improve where they live and their quality of life. Life on Etrin is not too different from any other kingdom. The commoners work enough to supply for their homes and usually trade part of their crop and products on their villages. If their production yields more than necessary, they go to free traders and negotiate for tools or anything they want or need. On the past, an outsider wouldn't be so welcome. Now, thanks to the open borders and the presence of more adventurers on the kingdom, they will provide shelter and the minimum to survive. Foreigners, mages, and non-humans with a strange mix of fear and respect, etrinian villagers are slow to trust. Once the newcomer is deemed worthy, will have a new place to call home.

==== Politics ====
The local noble houses and their allies rule, manage and protect Etrin. Once a feudal country, with the five Founding Houses as their lords, they evolved to a constitutional monarchy were the vassals became members of the executive power. As a constitutional monarchy, they are divided into four Powers: Legislature, Executive, Judiciary, and Moderator.
The Legislature is an assembly of scholars and sages chosen by their renown and works. They write the laws, gathering every three years to discuss any changes that may be needed. The Executive is formed by the Voices, representatives of each Noble House and city, and must govern their domains and ensure its growth. The Judiciary applies, interpret and enforce the laws. Their members are chosen through two methods: the indication made by a non-noble Voice or through three different expertise tests made by older members of the Legislature. Last, but not least, the Moderator power, also known as The Royal Assembly, is above any decision made by the other Powers. It is commanded by the Blutmeister representative, that is the head of state and government, and assisted by the Council: the Counselor of Defence, a Norgrand member, the Counselor of Diplomacy, a Malkadir, the Counselor of Treasure, the Etar regent, and the Counselor of Secrets, a Ravenholdt member.

==== The Noble Houses ====
Etrin is famous for their Noble Houses, the vassals and allies of the founding fathers of the kingdom. Every Noble House has some cities and villages that they are bound by oath to protect, collect taxes, and support. They have a personal plot of land to grow their share of the crop, a seat among the Voices and an office on Blutgart. They have to respond for any complaints that the Royal Auditors hear when travelling their realm, ensuring that no lord is treating their vassals with tyranny. The most prominent noble houses in Etrin are the Founding Houses: Blutmeister, Norgrand, Ravenhold, D'Etar, and Malkadir. Each of them has, besides what every Noble House have, at least four allied houses and one Inquisition Cadre.
Three groups of people form a Noble House. The first is the main family, the direct descendants of their founder that usually rule and speak for the House. Second are the blood brothers, people that are adopted or protected by the House and that have the power inside the House to discuss its decisions. Last, but not least, are the servants that work for the family, those do not hold diplomatic power inside the family but usually work as counsellors. While it is not impossible to rise from your position, it is unusual to become something more than a blood brother.
The Inquisition Cadres are secret groups of trusted members of the families that work in the shadows to ensure the advance of their House agenda. They are trained in secrecy and receive the best equipment that their House can afford for their missions. Usually, they are ascending members inside the family, for being an Inquisitor is an honour that few are allowed to have. Every Inquisitor holds a Rosetta, a unique signet made of witchstone that holds their shield of arms. It will enable them to feel when non-Sanctioned magic is being used inside the local witchstone range of detection.
Each Inquisition has a different focus and modus operandi. The Blutmeister Inquisition focuses on dealing with threats to the throne and treachery among the nobles, training their Cadres as spies courtesans and black ops operational. Their leader is Viktor Blutmeister, codename Butcher, Queen Victoria's older brother, and former Royal Guard's captain. The Norgrand Inquisition is a special task force commanded by Lord Hector Norgrand aka Barrage, brother of Counselor General Norgrand. They are deployed against outside threats that may compromise the peace held by the League of Aerin, being the only Cadre to act on foreign land usually.
The Ravenholdt has essentially two Cadres, the Ravenholdt Inquisition and the Talons. The Talons are led by Edgar Ravenholdt, the Ravenholdt firstborn, and are focused on secure dangerous or ancient artefacts and blueprints, their containment and to protect both the acquisitions and the common populace from them. The Ravenholdt Inquisition has three duties: maintenance of Cage Labs, secret dungeons where arcane power of dangerous and non-sanctioned mages is drained to fuel the most potent etrinian artefacts, development of new methods to turn the Sanctioning a more efficient process and to stabilize and purify the witchstones, giant subterranean monoliths that detect magic.
Etar has not an Inquisition since Lord D'Etar death, but an open task force that works as the regent personal intelligence. Lastly, the Malkadir Inquisition. They are led by Aaron and Ada Malkadir, Heinz adoptive daughter and his brother. Their Cadre replaced the Hunters in the city, taking care of what comes through the port and dealing directly and openly with supernatural threats against their town. The commoners don't know that they are an Inquisition Cadre and assume the Malkadirs like to protect their turf personally. The Malkadir has one of the smallest Cadres; therefore, their members usually rely on their versatility and wits. Sometimes they are going to post a series of missions and tasks at the House of Arms or the Protectors local quarters, to prospect for potential members and to relieve part of their load.

==== The Sanctioning ====
A trail of gold and silver etched on the face and hands that glows whenever the power surges through the caster, is the Brand of a Sanctioned Arcanist. The Sanctioning, a ritual as old as Etrin, was created after a simple dilemma: how they were going to know if a caster was an ally or a member of the Soul Covenant trying to infiltrate their kingdom? How could they know if a new wizard or sorcerer would not turn to the Covenant that once enslaved them? The Ravenholdt designed a ritual named The Sanction. To understand the Sanction is necessary to know about the witchstones.
The Soul Covenant conquered and fought to maintain control over the Purpur Field for only one reason, the giant soapstone monoliths that exist underground. These are the witchstones, unusual rock formations that stores the raw power of the closest leyline. A witchstone naturally resonates with magic, allowing anyone with control and focus to use the power it has to fuel rituals and spells or trace back the ether to sources of magic. The Ravenholdt developed a three-step method that would help to not only locate mages but also to weaken the power of any caster too powerful or unruly to be Sanctioned.
The Hunters locate the mages and take them to the closest Academy of Sanction, there the subjects are purified from any disease, infestation or curse. The Sanction can take a heavy toll on the mages, so they are also nurtured to an ideal weight and health state. Only after that preparation, the Sanctioning can begin. First, they graft several shards of witchstone surgically on their back and the wounds sealed with a special wax made of propolis and health balm. During this step, subjects receive a specialized mental endurance training, to become able to bear the pain caused by the changes their ether is undergoing. At this point, failure usually results in the complete loss of arcane power or permanent paraplegia.
After six months, the shards are removed and regrafted on the hands. After this procedure the mages are exposed to a cracked witchstone, that is continually leaking ether, while rituals to make their bodies accept the, now unstable, witchstones inside them. They fuse gold and silver onto their shards, shaping them to what will turn to be the Brand. It will "filter" the user's ether before casting as a way to generate a different kind of resonance. This excruciating process is repeated daily during a year and a half. Any mage that becomes unstable during this step is sent to a Cage Lab to fuel Etrin's most potent artefacts or is executed. The survivors are taken to the last level, two years of indoctrination and training. There, the weakest will be brainwashed into an emotionless tool of power and magic, and the strongest and most loyal will be prepared to become officials on the army. The whole process is kept partially in secret, the only information the commoners have about it are rumours.

==== The Church of Aerin and Etrin ====
Blutgart's central plaza has some of the most famous buildings on the kingdom, between them is The Cathedral of Aerin. The building has a welcoming aura, with stained glass windows picturing some of the greatest moments of the goddess glory and beautiful ivory walls. The Cathedral is tended by the clergy and the House Carol, the lineage that comes from the first Archbishop. They try to teach the ordinary people to embrace more than their communities and to always treat the outsider as part of the group, with little success until the last decade. Thanks to some mishappenings in the past, the Council now holds no power over the church's decisions and can't arrest or touch someone who is inside aerinian temples.

==== The Etrinian Military ====
One of the most well-trained armies in the world, the etrinian military had to work with whatever equipment they got until the opening of the borders made the prime matter flow. Their force is divided into four groups: the Army, the Guard, the Navy, and the Hunters. The Navy and the Army must protect the borders, defend roads and trade routes, and be the effective infantry if any conflict arises. The Guard is the city main defence force, garrisoning towers and walls, patrolling the streets, and helping with fires or accidents. The Hunters are a specialized force used to investigate, search, and capture whatever they are sent after. To be part of the etrinian military power, you had to go through the Sieve at Fort Norgrand and finish the three-year training.

===== Groups and Places of Interest =====
Besides the Noble Houses and the Inquisition, there are other major powers in the kingdom. The Protectors are an adventuring guild created by Aramir Phan of Snir and Royce of the South, vowing to put the safety of the common populace first. The guild accepts mission requests as any other company of arms or adventuring guild but denies claims that seek to bring harm onto the innocent. Besides that, the guild itself can pledge to protect high-risk areas, using these moments to test and evaluate those who answer the call. Thanks to this, holding their signet is usually enough to make the commoners treat a Protector better than they would treat any adventurer.
Baldinar Avvan, a young drow born in Blutgart, and Ana Carol, second on the succession of House Carol, founded the Embassy. It is a joint effort that desires a more welcoming Etrin. They support free traders, foreigners, adventurers, and non-humans with lawyers, high-quality services, and shelter in a city that would treat them poorly. Recently Queen Victoria has been negotiating ways to support their organization alongside the Sil'Gol Dwarven Bank, which was funding similar actions through the kingdom.
The Revolutionary Arcane Movement is the result of years of abuse against mages. Once the Arcane Front, they fought pacifically against the prejudice using speeches and community work while suffering moral attacks and arrests. Their leader, Eve D'Etar put an end to this era of peace, revealing herself and melting the Blood Throne's front door. Nowadays they attack Hunters moving mages to the Sanctioning and Noble Houses that support the status quo. Their camp is hidden somewhere in the northern forests, receiving the support of both mages and non-mages and keeping their position always two steps ahead from pursuers.
Every major town in the kingdom has a House of Arms to make and accept requests, a Mage Tower to study the arcane arts, and a SilGol Vault to store goods and money. In Gran Port, you can go to the docks and buy passage to other ports alongside the southern coast or Arkan. You can also spend your day on the Open Market, the best place to get products that come from other kingdoms. In Ravenest the Artisan Boulevard provides you with experimental and custom designs for everything, from fire-resistant ropes to full suits of armour that enhance your natural abilities. Blutgart has its share of points of interest. At the Central Plaza, you can visit the Lilium Garden, pay respects on the Martyr Monolith, visit the House of Arms or the Protectors or even rest and pray at the Cathedral.

===== Legends and Rumors =====
* Etrin is the name of a legendary beast, a chimaera that vowed to not only never harm an innocent soul but to protect them the best as it could. When Dorulgar sent a horde of beasts to assault the villages of the land, Etrin holds the passage in the mountains alone, waiting for help. The villagers prayed for Aerin's intervention, but when she arrived, she mistook Etrin for the enemies leader and rushed to it. The kind-hearted beast would never raise a paw against the goddess and was slain in one swift slash. After purging the place Aerin went to the people, that asked where their defender was. Aerin, ashamed of her crime, said that the creature died before her arrival, but they could rest knowing that the beast would be honoured. Bringing forth her celestial powers, she made a spring at the death's place and claimed the soul of Etrin to become its Animus. When the monster arose, instead of asking for a more significant punishment, it asked for a drop of blood to make the waters always pure. The goddess cried and asked for forgiveness, and with her tears and blood, Etrin, now Etrin the Pure, created Lech and Moselle. Thanks to that, any flower that is irrigated with their waters turn to red and purple.

* In Blutgart an illegal gladiator circuit happens, funded by nobles that want to watch non-humans fighting. These bloody battles move thousands of gold pieces, on events filled with prostitutes, drugs, and alcohol while leaving the fighters with barely enough to survive. Many choose this life looking for gold and glory, without pondering the results of the hardships they will have to go through. Vanish, a dwarf brawler and last champion have just disappeared before a fight for the title of Pit Champion.
