====== Etrin ======

The Kingdom of Etrin is a peninsular country, isolated by the sea around and the Dantarim Range. They are suspicious of foreigners, non-humans and magic. Even with this xenophobic side, they usually are willing to help their next of kin thanks to their connection to the Church of Aerin. One important thing to keep in mind while in Etrin is their rules and superstitions about the use of magic.

===== History =====
In the past, the land known as Purpur Fields was ruled by The Soul Covenant, a council of non-human witches that conquered the local clans and used them like cattle to their rituals and slaves to their domains. Rising against the Covenant was almost impossible until Heinzbarn Blutmeister, an apothecary serving under the Witch Queen, found an old ritualistic scroll that contained The Blood Pact, the same spell used by the Witch Queen to bind herself to the other witches. 

Understanding this as his only chance to free his people, Blutmeister found allies in four other clans that were willing to fight against their tyrants: the warlord Eliah Norgrand, the runemaster Helen Ravenholdt, the smuggler Vincent Etar and the pirate brothers Edward and Francis Malkadir. After the ritual's end, their bodies were changed, they became resistant to the witches' mind control and hexes, while they became able to penetrate the enemies wards. 

After ten years of war and revolution, they took down Bloodboiler Avanca, the Witch Queen, and renamed Purpur Fields to the Free Land of Purpur. After five more years they united the Free Land to become the Kingdom of Etrin, named after a legendary beast that served Aerin, and Blutmeister was chosen by his peers as the First King.

Seven hundred years later Aerin was invaded by the Children of Runaar, an interplanar threat that forced the kingdoms of the continent to work together. Etrin's efforts were vital to the war, lending weapons and soldiers to spearhead the battle operations that led to the aerinian victory.

===== Geography and Demography =====
Etrin has a lot of arable land and two major rivers (Moselle and Lech) that spring in the mountains on the northern border. The weather is fair and there are four seasons of 3 months each.

 Nowadays Etrin has opened their borders a little more, negotiating with Dantarrim and Yshan for their exotic prime matters. The etrinian economy is now based on free trade, naval trade, state of art artifacts and agriculture. They used to mine the northern mountains and iron veils to supply the military and the artisans, that paired with strong agriculture and their xenophoby made them recluse and auto sufficient. 

 95% of the population is human, with the other 5% being dwarves and elves. There are, although, few spellcasters comprising 15% of the populace and being majorly arcane and divine casters.
 There are four important cities besides the capital, Etar, Granport, Fort Norgrand, and Ravenest. They are located close to each border, while Blutgart stays in the center of the kingdom.

Etar is the main commercial hub of the kingdom, it controls the flow of goods coming through the northern border, and just like Gran Port they do not have the same fear and despise for foreigners like the rest of the kingdom. The deceased Lord of Etar, Immanuel D'Etar, was a fair and wise man until his tragic death during the witch hunt against his younger daughter Eve, a natural pyromancer, while the child came to be the actual leader of the Arcane Liberation Force the whole family was purged. Nowadays Etar is managed by an elected regent that changes every two years.

On the western border, among the rock beaches sits Ravenest, where the secretive artificers of the Ravenholdt clan watch over the city from their sanctum, the Nevermore Tower. The city is auto-sufficient and focused on its art. They design, create and maintain all kinds of artifacts and magic items, the city is full of tradesmen and alchemists ready to enroll in a craft house to create the next greatest etrinian invention. Among the members of the clan, there are the Talons, a group that works together with the Ravenholdt Inquisition to secure, contain and protect blueprints and inventions.

Fort Norgrand is where all members of the etrinian military come from. Watching the eastern border, the fortress towers over the rocky beaches and farms. During The Sieve, the first year that suitors that want to join the military, the soldiers go through a rash mental and physical training at Fort Norgrand, where the officers root out the weak of mind and heart. After that those who didn't surrender will be sorted in the functions of the military, be it the Army, the Guard, the Navy, or the Hunters, and receive a more specific drill.

On the southern border rests Gran Port, Malkadir's domain. Gran Port is not only, as the name implies, Etrin's naval trade hub but also a beacon of free speech in the kingdom. Due to the constant contact with other cultures and ideas, Gran Port became a haven to non-sanctioned mages, druids and any non-human beings. The Malkadir Inquisition is the only cadre to work in broad daylight, helping the Guard and Hunters around the town and hiring adventurers and mercenaries to help.

And in the central region of the kingdom is their capital, Blutgart. The fortified city is a perfect circle divided into three areas, the core, the middle and the outer rings. The core, with the central plaza and governmental buildings; the middle ring, where most of the commerce and noble houses are; and the outer ring, the residential area for commoners and travelers. From any point of the city, you can see the Blood Throne and the Royal Academy of Sanction. One of the most remarkable things is that no white flowers grow in Blutgart, except in the royal palace. All others have a strange, blood crimson tint.


===== Culture =====
Etrin is a kingdom heavily influenced by their geographical isolation, the connections with the Church of Aerin, and their past conflicts with The Soul Covenant. Suspicious of foreigners, non-humans and spellcasters, living in close-knitted communities, the etrinian commoner lives to improve where they live and their quality of life. Life on Etrin is not too different from any other kingdom, the commoners work enough to supply for their homes and usually trade part of their crop and products on their villages. If their production yields more than necessary they go to free traders and negotiate for tools or anything they want or need. On the past, an outsider wouldn't be so welcome. Now, thanks to the opening of borders and the presence of more adventurers on the kingdom, they will provide shelter and the minimum to survive. Foreigners and non-humans are treated with a strange mix of fear and respect, etrinian villagers are slow to trust but once the newcomer is deemed worthy it will have a new place to call home.


==== Politics ====
Etrin is ruled, managed and protected by the local noble houses and their allies. Once a feudal country, with the five founding houses as their lords, they evolved to a constitutional monarchy were the vassals became members of the executive power. As a constitutional monarchy they are divided into four powers: Legislature, Executive, Judiciary, and Moderator.

The Legislature writes the laws and is formed by an assembly of sages and scholars chosen by their renown and works, gathering every three years to discuss any changes that may be needed. The Executive is formed by the Voices, representatives of each noble house and city, and must govern their domains and ensure its growth. The Judiciary applies, interpret and enforce the laws. Their members are chosen through two methods: the indication made by a non-noble Voice or through three different expertise tests made by elder members of the Legislature. Last, but not least, the Moderator power, also known as The Royal Assembly, is above any decision made by the other powers. It is commanded by the Blutmeister representative, that is the head of state and government, and assisted by the Council: the Counselor of Defence, a Norgrand member, the Counselor of Diplomacy, a Malkadir, the Counselor of Treasure, the Etar regent, and the Counselor of Secrets, a Ravenholdt member.

==== The Noble Houses ====
Etrin is famous for their noble houses, the vassals and allies of the founding fathers of the kingdom. Every noble house has some cities and villages that they are bound by oath to protect, collect taxes, and support, a personal plot of land to grow their share of the crop, a seat among the Voices and, at least, an office on the capital. They have to respond for any complaints that the Royal Auditors hear when traveling their realm, ensuring that no lord is treating their vassals with tyranny. The most prominent noble houses in Etrin are the Founding Houses: Blutmeister, Norgrand, Ravenhold, D'Etar, and Malkadir. Each of them has, besides what every noble house have, at least four allied houses and one Inquisition Cadre.

A Noble House is formed by three groups of people. The first is the main family, the direct descendants of their founder that usually rule and speak for the House. Second are the blood brothers, people that are adopted or protected by the House and that have the power inside the House to discuss its decisions. Last, but not least, are the servants that work for the family, those do not hold diplomatic power inside the family but usually work as counselors. While it is not impossible to rise from your position, it is unusual to become something more than a blood brother.

The Inquisition Cadres are secret groups of trusted members of the families that work in the shadows to ensure the advance of their House agenda. They are trained in secrecy and receive the best equipment that their house can afford for their missions. Usually, they are ascending members inside the family, for being an Inquisitor is an honor that few are allowed to have. Every Inquisitor holds a Rosetta, a special signet that holds their shield of arms and is made of witchstone shards, allowing them to feel when non-Sanctioned magic is being used inside the local witchstone range of detection.

Each Inquisition has a different focus and modus operandi. The Blutmeister Inquisition is focused on dealing with threats to the throne and treachery among the nobles, training their Cadres as spies courtesans and black ops operational. They are led by Viktor Blutmeister, codename Butcher, Queen Victoria's older brother, and former Royal Guard's captain. The Norgrand Inquisition is a special task force commanded by Lord Hector Norgrand aka Barrage, brother of Counselor General Norgrand, and deployed against external problems that may compromise the peace held by the League of Aerin, being the only Cadre to usually act on foreign land.

The Ravenholdt has essentially two Cadres, the Ravenholdt Inquisition and the Talons. The Talons are led by Edgar Ravenholdt, the Ravenholdt firstborn, and are focused on securing dangerous or ancient artifacts and blueprints, their containment and to protect both the acquisitions and the commoners. While the Talons work with obtaining artifacts and engines, the Ravenholdt Inquisition has three duties: maintenance of the Cage Labs, secret dungeons where the arcane power of dangerous and non-sanctioned mages is drained to fuel the most powerful etrinian artifacts, development of new methods to turn the Sanctioning a more efficient process, and to stabilize and purify the witchstones, giant subterranean monoliths that detect magic.

Etar has not an Inquisition since Lord D'Etar death, but an open task force that works as the regent personal intelligence. Lastly, the Malkadir Inquisition. They are led by Aaron and Ada Malkadir, Heinz adoptive daughter and his brother. Their Cadre replaced the Hunters in the city, dealing directly and openly with threats against their town. The commoners don't know that they are actually an Inquisition Cadre and just assume the Malkadirs like to protect their turf personally.

==== The Sanctioning ====
A trail of gold and silver etched on the face and hands, that glows whenever the power surges through the caster, is the Brand of a Sanctioned Arcanist. The Sanctioning is a ritual as old as Etrin, being created after a simple dilemma: how they were going to know if a caster was an ally or a member of the Soul Covenant trying to infiltrate their kingdom? How could they know if a new wizard or sorcerer would not turn to the Covenant that once enslaved them? The Ravenholdt designed a ritual named The Sanction. To understand the Sanction it must be known about the witchstones.

The Soul Covenant conquered and fought to maintain control over the Purpur Field for only one reason, the giant soapstone monoliths that exist underground. These are the witchstones,  special rock formations that stores the raw power of the closest leyline. A witchstone naturally resonates with magic, allowing anyone with enough control and focus to use all the power it has to fuel rituals and spells or trace back the ether to mages and supernatural creatures nearby. The Brand "filters" the user ether before casting, as a way to generate a different kind of resonance. The Ravenholdt developed a three-step method that would help to not only locate enemies and allies but also to low the power of any mage to powerful or unruly to be Sanctioned.

The Hunters locate the mages and take them to the closest Academy of Sanction, there the subjects are purified from any disease, infestation or curse. The Sanction can take a heavy toll on the mages, so they are also nurtured to an ideal weight and health state. Only after that preparation, the Sanctioning can begin. First, several shards of witchstone are surgically grafted on their back and the wounds sealed with a special wax made of propolis and health balm. During this step, subjects receive a special mental endurance training, to become able to bear the pain caused by the changes their ether is undergoing. At this point, failure results usually on the complete loss of arcane power or permanent paraplegia.

After six months the shards are removed and regrafted on the hands. After this procedure the mages are exposed to a cracked witchstone, that is constantly leaking ether, while rituals to make their bodies accept the, now unstable, witchstones inside them and to fuse gold and silver onto their shards, shaping them to what will turn to be the Brand. This extremely painful process is repeated daily during a year and a half, and any mage that becomes unstable during this step is sent to a Cage Lab to fuel Etrin's most powerful artifacts or is executed. The survivors are taken to the last step, two years of indoctrination and training. There, the weakest will be brainwashed into an emotionless tool of power and magic and the strongest and most loyal will be prepared to become officials on the army. The whole process is kept partially in secret, the only information the commoners have about it are rumors.

===== Legends and Rumors =====
* Etrin is the name of a legendary beast, a chimera that vowed to not only never harm an innocent soul but to protect them the best as it could. When Dorulgar sent a horde of beasts to assault the villages of the land, Etrin holds the passage in the mountains alone, waiting for help. The villagers prayed for Aerin's intervention, but when she arrived she mistook Etrin for the enemies leader and rushed to it. The kind-hearted beast would never raise a paw against the goddess and was slain in one swift slash. After purging the place Aerin went to the people, that asked where was their defender. Aerin, ashamed of her crime said that the chimera died before her arrival but they could rest knowing that the beast would be honored. Bringing forth her celestial powers, she made a spring at the death's place and claimed the soul of Etrin to become its Animus. When the monster arose, instead of asking for a greater punishment it asked for a drop of blood to make the waters always pure. The goddess cried and asked for forgiveness, and with her tears and blood, Etrin, now Etrin the Pure, created Lech and Moselle. Thanks to that, any flower that is irrigated with their waters turn to red and purple.
