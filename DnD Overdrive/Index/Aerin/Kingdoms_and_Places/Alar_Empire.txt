====== Alar Empire ======
Deep in the heart of Elthas Desert is the mysterious Alar Empire, which claims to itself the whole desert and its treasures. Malik Aethmar rules the place since the end of the Age of Strife. This longevity made the emperor target of rumours. The capital, Alar, is as opulent as Cathair Airgid and as defend as Fort Norgrand. Exotic races, elementals and genies are more common there, the League of Aerin even cogitated some involvement of the Empire with the Runnarian Invasion. Those that come from Alar have a piece of jewellery with an imperial signet.
