===== History =====
In the past, the land known as Purpur Fields was ruled by The Soul Covenant, a council of witches that conquered the local clans and used them like cattle to their rituals and slaves to their domains. Rising against the Covenant was almost impossible until Heinzbarn Blutmeister, an apothecary serving under the Witch Queen, found an old ritualistic scroll that contained The Blood Pact, the same spell used by the Witch Queen to bind herself to the other witches. 
Understanding this as his only chance to free his people, Blutmeister found allies in four other clans: the warlord Eliah Norgrand, the runemaster Helen Ravenholdt, the smuggler Vincent Etar and the pirate brothers Edward and Francis Malkadir. After the ritual's end, their bodies were changed, they became resistant to the witches' mind control and hexes, while they became able to penetrate the enemies wards. After ten years of war and revolution they took down Bloodboiler Avanca, the Witch Queen, and renamed Purpur Fields to the Free Land of Purpur. After five more years they united the Free Land to become  the Kingdom of Etrin, named after a legendary beast that served Aerin, and Blutmeister was chosen by his peers as the First King.
Seven hundred years later Aerin was invaded by the Children of Runaar, an interplanar threat that forced the kingdoms of the continent to work together. Etrin's efforts were vital to the war, lending weapons and soldiers to spearhead the battle operations that led to the aerinian victory.

===== Geography and Demography =====
Etrin has a lot of arable land and two major rivers (Moselle and Lech) that spring in the mountains on the northern border. The weather is fair and there are four seasons of 3 months each.
Nowadays Etrin has opened their borders a little more, negotiating with Dantarrim and Yshan for their exotic prime matters. The etrinian economy is based on free trade, naval trade, state of art artifacts and agriculture. 
95% of the population is human, with the other 5% being dwarves and elves. There are, although, few magic users comprising 15% of the populace and being majorly arcane and divine casters.
There are four important cities besides the capital, Etar, Granport, Fort Norgrand, and Ravenest. They are located close to each border, while Blutgart stays in the center of the kingdom.
Etar is the main commercial hub of the kingdom, it controls the flow of goods coming through the northern border, and just like Gran Port they do not have the same fear and despise for foreigners like the rest of the kingdom. The deceased Lord of Etar, Immanuel D'Etar, was a fair and wise man until his tragic death during the witch hunt against his younger daughter Eve, a natural pyromancer, while the child came to be the actual leader of the Arcane Liberation Force the whole family was purged. Nowadays Etar is managed by an elected regent that changes every two years.
On the western border, among the rock beaches sits Ravenest, where the secretive artificers of the Ravenholdt clan watch over the city from their sanctum, the Nevermore Tower. The city is auto-sufficient and focused on its art. They design, create and maintain all kinds of artifacts and magic items, the city is full of tradesmen and alchemists ready to enroll in a craft house to create the next greatest etrinian invention. Among the members of the clan, there are the Talons, a group that works together with the Ravenholdt Inquisition to secure, contain and protect blueprints and inventions.
Fort Norgrand is where all members of the etrinian military come from. Watching the eastern border, the fortress towers over the rocky beaches and farms. During The Sieve, the first year that suitors that want to join the military, the soldiers go through a rash mental and physical training at Fort Norgrand, where the officers root out the weak of mind and heart. After that those who didn't surrender will be sorted in the functions of the military, be it the Army, the Guard, the Navy, or the Hunters, and receive a more specific drill.
On the southern border rests Gran Port, Malkadir's domain. Gran Port is not only, as the name implies, Etrin's naval trade hub but also a beacon of free speech in the kingdom. Due to the constant contact with other cultures and ideas, Gran Port became a safe haven to non-sanctioned mages, druids and any non-human beings. The Malkadir Inquisition is the only cadre to work in broad daylight, helping the Guard and Hunters around the town and hiring adventurers and mercenaries to help.
And in the central region of the kingdom is their capital, Blutgart. The fortified city is a perfect circle divided into three areas, the core, the middle and the outer rings. The core, with the central plaza and governmental buildings; the middle ring, where most of the commerce and noble houses are; and the outer ring, the residential area for commoners and travelers. From any point of the city you can clearly see the Blood Throne and the Royal Academy of Sanction.  One of the most remarkable thing is that no white flowers grow in Blutgart, except in the royal palace. All other have a strange, blood crimson tint.

===== Culture =====
Etrin is a feudal country, heavily influenced by their geographical isolation, the connections with the Church of Aerin, and their past conflicts with The Soul Covenant.
