====== Kingdom of Lars ======
The prosperous and pacific Kingdom of Lars was founded just after the Runnarian Invasion, as the prize for the services of Lars of Melphys. Once a minor estate between Llaie and the mountains on Titan Spine, it grew to become an excellent place to live if it wasn't for a little prank curse created by Lars and Arkan. When anyone would receive a title or rise to a position of power, as unimportant it was, their old name was forgotten, and it would change to Lars of Melphys. The bard and the Archmage didn't remember how it happened, and for some reason, Arkan still don't.
