====== Gijur ======
The once green fields of Gijur were indeed an impressive view, hundreds of miles cultivated to feed the whole kingdom, healthy and fat cattle, large and well-organized roads that made the travel inside Gijur way faster. That was all before the Sea of Blades, that destroyed half of the Small Folk Kingdom of West. Now they finally rebuilt and are growing once again to become what they were. The Council of Three rules the nation: Julius, Master of Coin; Augustus, Master of Walls; and Caius, Master of Laws. These three do their best to make life in Gijur worthy of its citizens and teach to their citizens to be worthy of Gijur.
