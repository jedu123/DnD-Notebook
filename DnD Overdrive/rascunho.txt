====== rascunho ======

REINO DE LARS: A maior piada feita pelo bardo Lars obviamente foi o Juramento Arcano que ele lançou sobre esse país. Ao fim da invasão de Dune, cada um dos heróis da Liga de Aerin recebeu um reino para governar. Lars, que junto com a fama de um bardo genial vinha a de preguiçoso procrastinador, entrou em um acordo com o Grão-Mestre Arkan para todos aqueles que recebessem um cargo de poder, por menor que fosse, tivesse seu nome trocado para Lars. Fora a absurda quantidades de Lars no Reino de Lars não existe algo que destaque muito o reino. Uma população majoritariamente humana, com gente de toda raça podendo viver lá. Interessante notar que por algum motivo desconhecido, bardos são muito normalmente expulsos de lá. 
Q'RAH: Também conhecida como A Grande Pradaria, é o lar de diversos bandos nômades que sobrevivem da caça e do serviço mercenário. Lá é o único local em Aerin onde se pode encontrar Beemontes de Ferro, uma raça especial de fera que evoluiu durante a Invasão. Também conhecidos como Jaganatas Vivas, elas são o principal motivo para vinda de estrangeiros pois seu sangue é conhecido por ser capaz de fortificar qualquer coisa ou ser que entre em contato. Graças a sua regeneração e resiliência, extrair sangue deles é complexo o suficiente para evitar a caça extensiva. Existem rumores que o grupo chamado Pródigos Redimidos, um grupo de Filhos de Runar que se voltou contra sua estirpe e lutou de forma oculta ao lado da Liga de Aerin, hoje protege os filhotes e fêmeas de Q'rah assim como impede a ação mais pesada de grupos de salteadores e bandidos na Pradaria.
YSHAN: A república élfica de Yshan é algo fantástico de se ver. Também chamado de Reino de Prata, seus arrogantes moradores tem motivos de sobra para sentirem orgulho de sua cultura e arquitetura. Os elfos que moram lá são orgulhosos, arrogantes e cultos. Tendem a tratar as outras raças como crianças burras, não importando a situação. Mesmo assim, Yshan é um dos centros de estudo em arcanita e silverite, sendo o último o material básico de suas construções.
LLANO: O território de Llano é um local onde honra e brutalidade se encontram. Orcs, goblins, ogros, meio-orcs, gigantes e goliaths se uniram e criaram uma comunidade organizada, onde os atos falam mais do que seu nascimento. A brutalidade, competição e violência inerente dessas raças são extremamente enraizadas na sua cultura. Em Llano todos tem apenas um nome até receber outros como títulos. A justiça é normalmente reforçada pelo exército de Llano, mas é comum que moradores montem suas milícias e defendam seu próprio território. Llano não consideram seus combatentes soldados, e sim guerreiros. Eles tem como principal fonte de renda a exportação de tropas mercenárias, que tem a fama de sempre cumprir com o contrato. De forma semelhante aos anões, o povo de Llano não mente (com exceção dos goblins) por questões culturais e éticas, não por razões naturais.
GRAN PORT: A antiga enseada conhecida como Cálice de Aerin foi um dos locais mais drasticamente afetados pelo ataque de Dune. Quando o Mar de Lâminas foi criado grandes massas de terra foram erguidas perto das extremidades do deserto de ferro. Uma dessas massas veio como um aglomerado de ilhas no Cálice de Aerin, criando uma zona aparentemente inabitável. Quando o Almirante Wulf Larsen foi receber seu prêmio pediu a zona que agora é conhecida como Gran Port, um dos principais centros de troca do continente. Atualmente o local é governado pelo Almirante Van Weyden, um dos misteriosos protegidos de Larsen. Nativos de Gran Port tendem a ser grandes negociantes e marinheiros natos por causa do ambiente que vivem, sendo os únicos capazes de manter um fluxo considerável de contato com Sanken mesmo depois de seu isolamento.
IMPÉRIO ALAR: Cravado no coração do Deserto de Elthas existe o misterioso Império Alar, um lugar que clama ser dono de todo o deserto e de seus tesouros. O Sultão Aethmar governa desde que se tem conhecimento do império, sendo alvo de diversos rumores graças a sua longevidade. A capital, Alar, é uma cidade tão opulenta quanto as maiores cidades de Yshan e tão bem protegida quanto as fortalezas de Etrin. A grande quantidade de extra-planares lá leva a Liga de Aerin a acreditar no envolvimento direto na invasão de Dune e na futura invasão abissal, por mais que os gênios e elementais que habitem o local neguem qualquer ligação com os "insetos de aço". Aqueles que nascem em Alar são normalmente servos fiéis do Sultão, não sendo incomum encontrar genasi ou elementais do fogo e da terra no local.
GIH'JURA: Os outrora campos verdejantes de Gih'Jura eram uma visão impressionante, com suas milhas de terra cultivada que alimentavam boa parte da pólis e era um dos principais produtos de exportação. Hoje, com a zona afetada pelo aço do Mar de Lâminas, a terra do Povo Pequeno sofre. Graças aos esforços do Mestre da Moeda, Gih'Jura trabalha para se reerguer enquanto mantém a fronteira do Mar de Lâminas sobre controle. O comando do governo fica na mão dos três Exemplares: Julius,o Mestre da Moeda; Augustus, o Mestre das Muralhas; e o Mestre do Povo, Caius. As leis tradicionais de Gih'Jura funcionam em conjunto com os decretos dos Exemplares, que representam as maiores raças de lá (anões, gnomos e halflings). A organização das cidades-estado na Liga de Ponese é uma das coisas que mantém a Grande Pólis unida. A maior pena para um cidadão é sempre o exílio, ser expurgado de tudo o que Gih'Jura representa.
ATARKA: Atarka é sem sombra de dúvidas um reino que mal sofreu com os efeitos do tempo. O local data desde as eras antigas, antes dos humanos aparecerem no mundo, quando os dragões resolveram criar os draconatos para servi-los e adora-los. Lá estão parte dos mais velhos e poderosos segredos de Aerin guardados pelos Herdeiros de Galakrond, draconatos responsáveis por manter e ensinar as tradições de seu povo. O povo de Atarka e seus senhores acreditam na imutabilidade das coisas, um fazendeiro sempre será fazendeiro, um soldado sempre será um soldado. Pessoas se mudarem para Atarka apenas por desejo pessoal são tratadas com estranheza, enquanto aqueles que tem bons motivos para isso são sempre bem recebidos. A vasta maioria de Atarka são os draconatos, seguidos pelos meio-dragões.
DUNOKAN: A história de Dunokan está diretamente ligada ao fator que ajudou Aerin na luta contra Dune. O plano de Dune era regido por duas entidades irmãs, Dunok e Runar. No começo da existência, o povo de Dune tinha couro e placas quitinosas como corpo, parecendo bastante com uma cruza entre artrópodes e humanos. Dunok, ao ver que mesmo as poderosas carapaças podia ser quebradas e o couro exposto, se uniu ao irmão e criou com ele uma versão superior dos corpos. Onde havia carapaça tinha agora poderosas placas de arcanita e etherium, no lugar de juntas havia correntes de mithril e biometal flexível. Porém os irmãos discordavam em diversas outras coisas e houve a cisão do povo de Dune. Aqueles que seguiam os ideais de bondade, honra e desenvolvimento pelo bem maior seguiram Dunok e se tornaram sua Legião, em suas armaduras vermelhas com prata eles construíram e pesquisaram, sempre evitando o combate com seus irmãos. Outros seguiram Runar, e dele se consideravam Filhos, suas armaduras reforçadas pelo aço negro e marcadas com glifos dourados eram sinal de grandes batalhas em nome da glória, sendo sempre consumidos pela ambição infinita de seu patrono. Ambos existiam em uma trégua até o momento que a Legião descobriu algo que atraiu a atenção de Runar, a habilidade de se locomover para outros planos. Runar não exitou em combater seu irmão e ordenou que seus filhos tomassem o poderoso encanto dunokiano. Após grandes combates e muito sangue derramado, a muito custo Runar derrotou e aprisionou a essência do irmão enquanto seus Filhos mataram a maior parte da Legião. Com muito custo, o resto da Legião se jogou para o plano mais próximo e informou dos desejos de dominação de Runar. Graças aos meses de preparo antes da Invasão, Aerin conseguiu se preparar e combater os dunerianos inimigos. Ao fim da guerra, a Legião de Dunok recebeu como presente um bom território para chamar de lar. O reino se tornou Dunokan, O Refúgio de Dunok, lá os legionários reiniciaram sua cultura e povo. 
Um terço dos habitantes de Dunokan são Legionários, membros da Legião de Dunok que havia em Dune. O resto da população é divido entre os Herdeiros de Dunok, filhos de legionários com a população de Aerin e pesquisadores e estrangeiros, que encontraram no reino emergente um novo lar e oportunidade de vida, além de conhecimentos importantes para o desenvolvimento de ambos. Um dos pontos mais importantes de Dunokan é a Academia de Intercâmbio, onde membros importantes de Aerin e Dunokan compartilham conhecimento e cultura.
IMPÉRIO STRAD: O sombrio Império Strad é um dos locais mais belos e perigosos de todo o continente. O povo drow conseguiu expandir seu domínio e ocupar uma grande parte da superfície, se aliando a tieflings, gnomos de caverna e diversos povos de filhos da noite. Seu avanço nas artes arcanas, cultura e artífices são a maior razão da vinda de estrangeiros. No reino, a cultura matriarcal e escravista drow foi facilmente assimilada por boa parte das raças. Liderados pelo Conselho da Viúva, o Império está atualmente em trégua com os outros locais. Todas as raças são bem vindas em Strad, desde que paguem seus impostos e estejam dispostos a ter uma mente mais aberta e mais eticamente cinza. O povo é normalmente cordial e romântico, lembrando muito personagens de um drama cavalheiresco, mas por trás de cada sorriso existe uma adaga e por trás de cada palavra doce, o veneno.
SANKEN: Aqueles que foram tocados pelos planos elementais, ou que vieram de lá, nunca encontraram uma terra para chamar de sua. Aracroka, Genassi, Tieflings... sempre forasteiros até que seus campeões venceram durante a investida final da Liga. Quando as terras foram divididas entre os povos, os Peregrinos, como eram conhecidos, pediram pelo arquipélago perdido de Sanken. Quase ninguém conseguia chegar, sendo conhecido como o espaço de mar raso próximo a costa de Strad e Alar, porém quando a primeira frota comerciante foi em direção à Sanken ela encontrou um local belo e verdejante. Como as rotas para Sanken mudam constantemente, apenas a posição aproximada é vista no mapa. Qualquer descendente planar em Aerin tem boas chances de vir daqui.
MAR DE LÂMINAS: A Cicatriz de Aerin. Uma gigantesca faixa de ferro que corta o continente de uma ponta a outra. Outrora a principal linha de defesa dos Filhos de Runar, agora ela é uma marca no continente que  impede a batalha contra Dune de ser esquecida. Dizem que em paragens inóspitas e pouco conhecidas do Deserto de Aço ainda há sobreviventes dos Filhos de Runar esperando o momento de sua vingança.
